          <p>The float: left; property in CSS is used to make an element (like a div, image, 
            or paragraph) align to the left side of its container. When you apply float: left; 
            to an element, it will move to the left edge, and other content will wrap around it 
            on the right side.

                  float: right; to an element, it will align to the right edge, and other content

             <p class="clear-right"> The clear: right; property in CSS is used to prevent an 
               element from sitting next to (on the right side of) any floated elements. When 
               you apply clear: right; to an element, it will move down below any elements that 
               are floated to the right.

          <p class="clear-both"> The clear: both; property is used to control how an element 
            interacts with floated elements above it. Specifically, when you apply clear: both; 
            to an element, you are telling the browser that this element should not sit next to any 
            floated elementsâ€”whether they are floated to the left or right. Instead, the element with 
            clear: both; will be pushed down until it is completely below all preceding floated elements.
